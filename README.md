My first MVC project. Food truck website for a friend with functionality requested. Still an ongoing project and alot more for me to learn.

Website provides a form to take customer details with validation, a thank you page is then shown and an email sent to the email provided in the form confirming the submition.

To login to the Admin area, Username: admin Password: secret

The admin area provides a table of bookings submitted via the form with basic CRUD functionality, the table can be sorted by name, surname, date of event. The results can also be filtered by status flag or alternatively it is possible to search for a name in either the surname or name fields.

Using the Edit option enables users to change the status flags and add notes to the bookings, as well as ammend entries. With delete removing the entry from the database.
